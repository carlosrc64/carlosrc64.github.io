	<p>New Horizons is a space probe designed by NASA that recently flew close to Pluto, being
	the first human object to take a closer look to this dwarf planet and to take detailed
	pictures of its surface. This probe program was one of the few programs left from massive NASA
	budget cuts due to less interest in space and a worsened economy in the late 2000s. One of the chief reasons it was 
	very important to send a probe around the late 2000s was because the probe would fly close to the planet Jupiter,
	and gravity effects would allow for the probe to travel at a much greater pace than it would usually happen.  </p>
	
	<p>For many years Pluto was on researchers's mind as the last unexplored planet, as even Uranus and Neptune had detailed
	photos of their surface whereas the highest detailed photo of Pluto was only about a dozen pixels, which is basically nothing distinguishable.
	People's perception of Pluto then, with no clear evidence went wild. Some people in the past pondered if Pluto had an atmosphere or earth. The popular
	conception was always of a blue, always snowing planet. As details came from this probe, the truth came to be much different than that.</p>

	<p> The mission's first target was Jupiter, where some studies were done on its atmosphere and magnetosphere. These procedures took place in 2007, and it would
	take a whopping 8 years more  for the probe to finally reach Pluto, which shows how immense the dimensions of only a relatively small area(when taking the whole
	Milky Way galaxxy into account) like the Solar System
	really are. </p>
	<p>The probe finally reached Pluto on July, 2015. At first taking lower resolution photos that were sent to Earth quickly after. Afterwards more detailed photos were taken,
	with the probe showing Pluto's real color, a very reddish hued planet with minimal atmosphere but also full of ice(like it was always assumed). New Horizons also took detailed photos
	of Pluto's biggest moon, Charon, as well as nearby satellites.

	<p>The probe is still operational as of this writing, and will continue flying away from the Solar System, passing through the Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud in some time and going beyond that.
